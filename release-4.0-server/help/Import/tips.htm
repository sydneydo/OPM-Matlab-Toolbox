	<h3>Best Practices</h3>
	<ol>
		 <li ID="team1">
			 <b>Build a skeleton of the global project first - </b>Before distributing the work to different teams, it is advisable to construct
			 the skeleton of the global model. The skeleton should hold an OPD or OPM thing for each model which is developed each team. <br>
			 <br>
		 </li>
		
		<li ID="team2">
			<b>Keep a separated Copy of your project - </b>As the Import feature in Opcat is not kept as a live link between the projects, every change in the
			imported files will not be reflected in the global model. Thus, it is advisable to hold and work on the separate files. The global model should not
			be worked on as a regular model file.<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		
		<li ID="team3">
			<b>Save before importing - </b>The import operation is not 
			undoable. It is advisable to create a backup of the model before importing. 
			Backup is easily done by saving the model under a different name. <br>
			<br>
		</li>
		
		<li ID="team4">
			<b>Measure before importing - </b>As imported models are copied 
			exactly as they were in the original model, a good idea will be to take a 
			good look at the model you wish to import before performing import. If needed, 
			change it to suit the new model.<br>
			<br>
		</li>
		
		<li ID="team4">
			<b>Importing into inzoomed things - </b>It is very common to
			import into an in-zoomed thing (process or object). In order to make sure that
			the thing can contain the imported model, it is advisable to enlarge 
			the zoomed-in thing before importing. <br>
			<br>
		</li>
