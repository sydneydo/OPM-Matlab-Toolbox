<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font size="4">Object-Process Methodology (OPM) is a comprehensive approach to system
evolution</font><font size=+1> </font><font size="4">that incorporates the
static-structural and dynamic-procedural aspects of a system into a single
unifying model. OPM includes a clear and concise set of symbols that form a language enabling
the expression of the system's building blocks and how they relate to each
other.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OPM represents
the two things that are inherent in a system: its objects and its processes. Objects are what a
system or product is. Processes are what a system does. OPM represent both objects and
processes, and explicitly shows the connections between them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OPM has another fundamental advantage - it represents
the system simultaneously in a graphic representation and in a natural
language. The two are completely interchangeable, and represent the same
information. The advantage in this approach lies in appreciating the human
limitation to the understanding of complexity. As systems become more complex,
the primary barrier to success is the ability of the human designers and
analysts to understand the complexity of the interrelationships. By representing
the system in both textual and graphical form, the power of "both sides
of the brain" - the visual interpreter and the language interpreter - is
engaged.&nbsp;</font>
